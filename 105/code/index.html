<h1>How to install a local file of my website.</h1>
<button type="button" onclick="darkmode()">Change Theme</button>

<span><p>1). Click this link ---> <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OzopegOifkjQ1JsGAIEOT6uHXcGGus2w?usp=share_link" target="_blank">Link</a></p></span>
<p>2). Then press download all in the upper right hand corner</p>
<p>2.5). Wait for it to finish downloading.</p>

<img src="img.png" alt="Image" width="600" height="338">
<p>3). Then click your files app by pressing the dot at the bottom left hand corner of the screen and searching "file" and pressing enter.</p>
<img src="img2.png" alt="Image2" width="600" height="338"> -----> <img src="img3.png" alt="Image3" width="600" height="338"> 
<p>4). now go to your downloads folder</p>
<img src="img4.png" alt="Image4" width="600" height="338">
<p>5). You have a couple options here.  Option 1: Double click (click it twice) the .zip file named "Sebastian105-20221118T211523Z-001" (or something similar) (you can rename it to whatever you want).</p>
<img src="img5.png" alt="Image5" width="600" height="338">
<p>6). then you should see something like this. (note: I am on a guest account so you will have a drive part under the downloads section) (Note2: the blue arrow is important make sure you have that .zip file thing there).</p>
<img src="img6.png" alt="Image6" width="600" height="338">
<p>7). now you can double click the Sebastian105 folder. Then double click one of these. . . </p>
<img src="img7.png" alt="Image7" width="600" height="338">
<p>8). After that you double click index.html (doesnt matter which folder)</p>
<img src="img8.png" alt="Image8" width="600" height="338">
<p>9). If you choose "sebastian105" folder to open the index.html file, than you have to make sure to not close the zip file. If you do it wont work.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">----------OPTION 2----------</h2>
<p>1). Option 2: (This option takes longer and is harder to understand so you might just want to stick to option 1.  Also I wont include pictures so you just have to deal with it). You right click the file, on a chromebook you press alt and simultaneously click the file.  You should see a menu appear under it.  If not then you screwed up somehow.</p>
<p>2). In the menu you should see a option that says "extract all", click that.  Once that happens you have to wait (the time varies with the size of the file and said computers framerate).</p>
<p>3). Congratulations! You have just made a editable folder with my code in it.</p>
<p>4). In order to edit it you have to get a text editior tho. . . so . . . yeah. . .</p>
<p>5). From here on out its your decision on what you do next.  I'm not going to teach you how to code, But I hope this came in handy.</p>
<p>also if the I.T. department blocks this than just rename the folder or the zip file.  (for you nerds, it creates a new-unblocked-url).</p>
<p>One more thing. . .</p>
<p>If you ever create a dupicate of this site. . .</p>
<p><strong>CITE ME!!!</strong></p>  
<p>I trust you will cite me because I just spent a solid hour on this page alone and you wouldn't rip me off, now would you?</p>
